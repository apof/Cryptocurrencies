# Cryptocurrencies
Cryptocurrencies classification and price Prediction using Deep Learning

-->Use of MLP(Multilayer Perceptron-Feedforward Network),RNN(Multilayer LSTM and GRU cell), and BiDirectional RNN (GRU cell) for cryptocurrencies classification and bitcoin price prediction (regression) using Tensorflow.

All my results can be found in the Report.pdf. This document is written in Greek but there are tables and graphics that illustrate my measurements
